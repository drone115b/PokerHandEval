# PokerHandEval
Poker hand evaluation and pretty-print for C++

There are faster hand evaluators out there, but this one emphasizes flexibility.
Any number of cards can be evaluated, which can be useful in simulations and some kind of specialty games.
Also, an optional "pretty print" of the hand can be optionally created which is helpful in some interactive applications.
Hooks exist for future implementation of specialty evaluators, such as a hand evaluator for Razz.
